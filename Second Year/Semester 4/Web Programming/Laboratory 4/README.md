List by using XSLT all the movies playing this week in cinema. The movies are described in an XML document and have at least the followind attributes: title, actors, genre, date of playing, duration etc. Each movie genre should be formatted using a different Bootstrap CSS class.

Short description of the project:
To list all the movies playing this week in cinema you need to use XSLT to transform the XML document into HTML.

![transform.xsl](https://github.com/hognogicristina/UBB-Projects/blob/main/Second%20Year/Semester%204/Web%20Programming/Laboratory%204/transform.xsl) imports the Bootstrap stylesheet and defines two templates to transform the input XML file. The first template matches the root node and outputs an HTML document with a header and a body. The body contains a heading and a container for the movie panels, which are generated by the second template. The second template matches the movie elements that have a playing_date attribute that is less than or equal to the current date plus 7 days (i.e., the movies playing this week). Each movie is formatted as a Bootstrap panel with a title and a body that contains the movie details. The genre of each movie is used to define a CSS class for the genre text using the span element and the xsl:template that matches the genre element.

To use this stylesheet to transform an XML file with movies, you can apply it using an XSLT processor such as Saxon or Xalan. For example, if the stylesheet is saved as transform.xsl and the input XML file is saved as movies.xml, you can use the following command with Saxon:
  + java -jar saxon9he.jar -s:movies.xml -xsl:transform.xsl -o:output.html
