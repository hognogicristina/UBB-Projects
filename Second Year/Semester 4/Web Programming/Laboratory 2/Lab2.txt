Write a web page which shows 6 circles with the same center (i.e. the center of the screen), but increasing radiuses so that each circle 
contains the previous one and so on. Each circle should be colored (i.e. the inner part of the circle) with a different color.

Write a web page which should contains 4 divs in the center of the screen. All divs should have the same dimensions (width and height) and 
they should overlap (so that a single div is visible at a specific time). When the mouse gets over the divs from the center of the screen, 
all 4 divs shoud transition to the 4 corners of the screen.
