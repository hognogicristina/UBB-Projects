5. To reach the maximum efficiency in performing an assembling operation in a manufacturing 
plant, new employees are required to take a 1-month training course. 
A new method was suggested, and the manaager wants to compare the new method with the standard 
one, by looking at the lengths of time required for employees to assemble a certain device.
They are given below (and assumed approximately normally distributed):

Assembling times:
(Standard 46, 37, 39, 48, 47, 44, 35, 31, 44, 37)
(New: 35, 33, 31, 35, 34, 30, 27, 32, 31, 31)

a) At the 5% significance level, do the population variances seem to differ?
b) Find a 95% confidence interval for the difference of the average assembling times.
