"""
The implementation uses the Python language. For solving the problem statement we shall define a class named
TripleDictGraph which represents a directed graph, a class named UI for testing the operations and 2
additional functions for reading from a file and writing in a file. In what follows, an edge is considered
to be a tuple (origin, target). The isolated vertices are marked.
