This code is a C++ program that implements the Hill cipher encryption for a 2x2 Hill matrix. The Hill cipher is a symmetric key substitution cipher that works on groups of letters. In this case, it encrypts the plaintext input using a 2x2 matrix as a key. Here's an explanation of what the code does:

It includes necessary C++ standard library headers: <iostream>, <string>, and <vector>. These are used for input and output, working with strings, and defining the key matrix, respectively.
The hillCipherEncrypt function is defined. It takes two parameters:
plaintext (a reference to a string): The input plaintext to be encrypted.
keyMatrix (a reference to a 2x2 integer vector): The key matrix used for encryption.
Inside the hillCipherEncrypt function, the input plaintext is processed in 2-character blocks. For each block, the following steps are performed:
The characters in the block are converted to numerical values by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from them. This assumes that the input contains only uppercase letters.
Matrix multiplication is performed between the key matrix and the 2-character block.
The results of the matrix multiplication are taken modulo 26 to ensure they stay within the range of English alphabet letters.
The resulting numerical values are converted back to characters by adding 'A' to them, and then appended to the ciphertext string.
In the main function, a key matrix is defined with specific values (3, 2, 5, and 7) for encryption. These values should be kept secret and shared between the sender and the recipient.
The program asks the user to enter the plaintext (assuming uppercase letters only) using cin.
The hillCipherEncrypt function is called with the entered plaintext and the key matrix to encrypt the input.
The encrypted ciphertext is displayed as the output.
In summary, this code demonstrates how to perform Hill cipher encryption using a 2x2 matrix as the key. The user provides plaintext, and the program uses the provided key matrix to produce the ciphertext, which can then be transmitted securely to someone with the knowledge of the same key matrix for decryption.
